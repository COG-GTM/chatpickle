## Conversation Tests for Chatbots

* Document conversational scenarios using Cucumber's Gherkin syntax.
* Run them as tests against your deployed chatbot.
* Be confident in all of your bot's behaviors.
  
## Supported Chatbot Integrations
  * [AWS Lex](examples/lex/README_LEX.md)
    * Great for out of the box Lex
  * [Custom](examples/custom/README_CUSTOM.md)
    * Because we can't predict your use-case
    * Define your own bot integration by using a few simple methods (initialize, speak, and fetch)

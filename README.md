* Supported chatbot service integrations:
  * AWS Lex

#### Installing Chat Pickle
`npm install chatpickle --save-dev`

#### Create a chatpickle configuration json and chatpickle folder
The following sample project, [examples/parentProject](examples/parentProject), is designed to be pointed at the OrderFlowersBot as provided by AWS as a blueprint.

You need a `chatpickle.config.json` in the root of your node.js project and it should be formatted like the example provide above.

You also need a `chatpickle/` folder in the root of your project.  This is where you will put your gherkin feature files which can leverage the extended chatpickle syntax.

#### Setup a Lex Chatbot
To setup an OrderFlowersBot from a blueprint in your AWS account, follow the [AWS Docs Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/gs-bp-create-bot.html).

Or if you want to get started with chatpickling a custom lex bot,  alter your project's chatpickle config; see example at [chatpickle.config.json](examples/parentProject/chatpickle.config.json) 


#### Setup IAM Credentials
You will need to create IAM credentials that can invoke your bot. You can use the Amazon managed policies as shown below. Load them in your `.aws` directory.

#### Running Chatpickle
From your project root, or added as a script to your package.json:

`node node_modules/chatpickle/dist/index.js`

#### Extending Chatpickle
This release of Chatpickle was focussed around the AWS Lex service.  You can help extend chatpickle by contributing to our open source project [https://github.com/libertymutual/chatpickle](https://github.com/libertymutual/chatpickle) and by adding more bot clients to [src/lib/botClients](src/lib/botClients).
